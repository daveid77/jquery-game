## Misc Notes

* Tried Object-Oriented Javascript in homework for the first time.  Syntax is correct, I believe, but organization of variables and functions may not be ideal.  Feedback appreciated.  
* Among the UI enhancements beyond [demo game](http://ucb.bootcampcontent.com/UCB-Coding-Bootcamp/09-11-2017-UCB-Class-Repository-FSF-FT/raw/master/02-week/homework/part-2/homework_demos/starwars_demo.mp4):
  * Vanquished Opponents grouping added for defeated characters. 
  * Character section header text updates to match context. 
  * Cursor matches clickability or lack thereof for characters at various stages.
  * Used red as theme for "exciting" fighting area.
